    # Wizpick Felting Needles
    <span style="color: #E5651A">With the globaly recognised colour code system</span>

    There are endless possibilities, when working with wool.
    The hair from sheep is a sustainable, renewable resource, not to mention it's ability to keep you warm and dry.
    You can knit wool, weave wool or felt wool: wet felt it with soap and water or dry felt it with a felting needle or combine both methods.

    When jabbed into wool the barbs on the felting needle catch and tangle the fibre sculpturing fine detail.
    The gauge (diameter) for wool felting needles ranges from 32 (coarse) to 42 (super fine).
    In general, start your project with a coarser needle and work to a finer needle for finishing.
    Choose thicker needles to felt coarse fibers and finer needles when working with finer fibers.

    Felting needles can also be used to join yarn, to mend holes in felted or knitted fabric, for rooting doll hair or to start or maintain dreadlocks.
    Often wool is added to dreadlocks to create a unique hairdo.

    # Needle Felting Sets
    There are a few thousand different felting needles available for
    specific industrial applications.
    Wizpick felting needles have been carefully selected to cover every
    handicraft use. Flowers on felted bead jewelry demand or need different
    needles than life-size needle felted sculptures.
    Of course it takes some
    patience and practice to discover the uniqueness of each and every needle.
