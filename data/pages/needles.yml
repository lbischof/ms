    # Wizpick Felting Needles
    Felting needles are tools developed for and used in big machines to produce non woven textiles like car carpets.
    The artist and hand felter uses the felting needles to create beautiful objects made of wool roving.

    As your felting work becomes more precise you will appreciate the specialty of a specific felting needle.

    We are the Canadian distributor of [WIZPICK](http://wizpick.com) hand felting needles with the unique globally recognised colour code system which makes working with felting needles a lot less confusing:
    easy names to communicate with friends and fellow felters
    easy identification during the exciting needle felting process
  colours:
