    # Wizpick Felting Needles
    Felting needles are tools developed for and used in big machines to produce non woven textiles like car carpets.
    The artist and hand felter uses the felting needles to create beautiful objects made of wool roving.

    As your felting work becomes more precise you will appreciate the specialty of a specific felting needle.
