    # About
    It's about inspiring you, about making the world more colourful. Colour is life.
    Colour emerges when light meets darkness. The red yellow seam when light moves over dark and the blue purple seam when dark moves over light.
    Inspire your imagination and create a colourful life with children when the tactile experience of this renewable resource warms your heart.
    We carry felting wool in over 100 colours, fibres and locks, 100% wool felt and more.
    We are proud to be the Canadian Representative for Wizpick Felting Needles.

    easy to order... click all the colours you like, choose, compare and add them to the shopping cart all at once.
    Repeat for another quantity or another quality.

    <span style="color: #868920">I work with the wool myself, I am an avid felter and am happy to provide advise.
    After 29 years I have graduated  my career as a Waldorf mother and am in the process of returning to Canada,
    to the beautiful Cowichan Valley on Vancouver Island.  Helen</style>
