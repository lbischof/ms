    # Shopping information
    Welcome to Maplesplendor's new website... a bit more simple, I hope you like it.
    I really appreciate your feedback, any thoughts or questions?

    As most of you know we have been shipping from Europe for the last few years.
    Now back in Canada, stock needs to be organised, so just ask if you are looking for something we used to have.
    My son is holding the fort in Switzerland and will gladly still ship things over.
    As of April first more and more parcels will be shipped within Canada, which means we will be charging you taxes.

    As always, all prices are quoted and charged in <span style="color: #868920">Canadian dollars</span>.
    We accept Visa, Mastercard or American Express.
    Please use our secure shopping cart (lock in the address bar).
    There is a little message box at check out where you can leave us a note.
    #Shipping
    Shipping cost with Canada Post depends on size and weight, within BC costs less than to Eastern Canada.
    Our shopping cart now calculates $16 per parcel.
    We will reduce your charge if we need to pay less and notify you if it is more.
    Please bear with us until we figure this out.

    <span style="color: #868920">Felting needles can be shipped in an envelope.</span>

    Normally we do not include an invoice in the parcel.
    (paper is a natural resource and should not just be tossed in the waste basket.)
    If you would like to receive a detailed invoice (for example for tax purposes)
    please don't hesitate to email (or include a message in the message box) and we will gladly email you one.

    We  provide quality products. If for some reason you are not satisfied, please email us; we will be glad to assist you.
    Our parcels are packed with care, but possibly things happen to the boxes on their way to you.
    If an item arrives damaged, please let us know within 4 days of receiving your package.
    Please don't send returns without contacting us first.
