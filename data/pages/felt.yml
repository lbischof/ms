      # Felt
      Made of pure new wool, our craft weight 100% wool felt is 1mm thick and certified Oeko Tex 100, so it is safe for children.
      Wool felt is naturally nonflammable, dirt repellant and does not frey or tear.
      The raw wool comes mainly from Australia, but all steps of the production process take place in Western Europe.

      Felt can ship in an envelope.
