    # Corriedale
    Corriedale is courser (about 30 microns) and is preferred for needle felting simply because it is easier.

    Corriedale was crossbred between Merino ewes and Lincoln or Leichester males in Australia and NewZealand in the 19. hundreds.
    Middle length Corriedale fibre can easily be ripped shorter or tussled up.
    Corriedale makes a durable and hard wearing felt for toys when wet felted.
    Corriedale can be used as hair for puppets and to make mobiles because it never looks limp.

    # Merino
    Merino shrinks about one third, less the thinner it is applied.
    This very soft and fine wool is wonderful to work with. Details are more accurate than with other types of wool.
    Merino is the best wool for Nuno Felting on silk or cotton gauze.
    With the proper felting needle Merino can be delicately molded without single hairs protruding.
    For needle felting we recommend our Merino felting needle set.

    # Mohairlocks
    Hand dyed Kidmohairlocks are great for hair or beards. Goat's hair has a light shine.
    Sometimes there are little bits of straw or grass included. This means that the goats have a natural life.
    Big companies use chemicals to dissolve the vegetable matter.
    Our locks are hand dyed on the farm and are not carded in order to not disturb the curls.
