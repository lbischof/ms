      It all started years ago in Nelson, BC. Creativity can be soul saving for young families. I loved sharing my passion for felting in my store. Sourcing many of our quality Waldorf products in Europe, I have been able to visit many trade shows. Now back in BC, I continue to provide colourful products and expert advice.
